# The Derivative

<Definition title="The Derivative" subject="Calculus" topic="Differentiation">

The derivative of a function $f(x)$ at a point $x$ is defined as:

$$
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

This represents the instantaneous rate of change of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$.

</Definition>

# Geometric Interpretation

<Note type="important" importance="high">

The derivative $f'(x)$ gives us the slope of the tangent line at any point $x$ on the curve $f(x)$.

# The Chain Rule

<Theorem title="Chain Rule" author="Gottfried Leibniz" year="1676">

If $y = f(u)$ and $u = g(x)$, then:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx}
$$

</Theorem>

---

# Chain Rule Alternative Form

<Note type="tip" importance="medium">

The chain rule can also be written in alternative notation:

$$(f \circ g)'(x) = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)$$

This form is particularly useful when working with composite functions.

</Note>

# Chain Rule Example

<Example title="Chain Rule Application" topic="Differentiation" difficulty="Medium">

Find $\frac{d}{dx}[\sin(x^2)]$

Let $u = x^2$, then $y = \sin(u)$

</Example>

---

# Chain Rule Solution

<Answer>

Using the Chain Rule:

1) Let $y = \sin(u)$ where $u = x^2$
2) Then:
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   \frac{dy}{dx} &= \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx} \\
   &= \cos(u) \cdot \frac{d}{dx}(x^2) \\
   &= \cos(x^2) \cdot 2x \\
   &= 2x\cos(x^2)
   \end{aligned}
   $$

# Integration

<Definition title="Definite Integral" subject="Calculus" topic="Integration">

The definite integral of a function $f(x)$ from $a$ to $b$ is defined as:

$$
\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i)\Delta x
$$

This represents the area under the curve of $f(x)$ from $a$ to $b$.

</Definition>

# Fundamental Theorem

<Theorem title="Fundamental Theorem of Calculus" author="Newton-Leibniz">

If $F(x)$ is an antiderivative of $f(x)$, then:

$$
\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$

</Theorem>

---

# Proof of FTC

<Proof method="Direct" difficulty="Medium">

Let $F(x)$ be an antiderivative of $f(x)$. Then:

1) By definition, $F'(x) = f(x)$
2) Consider the difference $F(b) - F(a)$
3) By the Mean Value Theorem:
   $$F(b) - F(a) = \int_a^b F'(x)\,dx = \int_a^b f(x)\,dx$$

</Proof>

# Area Between Curves

<Question title="Area Problem" points={10} difficulty="Hard">

Find the area between the curves $y = x^2$ and $y = x$ from $x = 0$ to $x = 1$.

Hint: Draw a diagram to visualize the region.

</Question>

---

# Solution

<Answer>

Let's solve this step by step:

1) The area is given by: $\int_0^1 (x - x^2)\,dx$

2) Integrate:
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   \int_0^1 (x - x^2)\,dx &= \left[\frac{x^2}{2} - \frac{x^3}{3}\right]_0^1 \\
   &= \left(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3}\right) - (0 - 0) \\
   &= \frac{1}{6}
   \end{aligned}
   $$

Therefore, the area is $\frac{1}{6}$ square units.

# Important Tips

<Note type="tip" importance="medium">

When finding areas between curves:

1. Always identify which curve is on top
2. Subtract the lower curve from the upper curve
3. Set up the integral with correct bounds

# Practice Problems

<Example title="Integration by Parts" topic="Integration" difficulty="Hard">

Evaluate the integral:
$$\int x\ln(x)\,dx$$

</Example>

---

# Solution

<Answer>

Using integration by parts formula $\int u\,dv = uv - \int v\,du$:

1) Let $u = \ln(x)$ and $dv = x\,dx$
2) Then $du = \frac{1}{x}\,dx$ and $v = \frac{x^2}{2}$
3) Therefore:
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   \int x\ln(x)\,dx &= \frac{x^2}{2}\ln(x) - \int \frac{x^2}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{x}\,dx \\
   &= \frac{x^2}{2}\ln(x) - \frac{1}{2}\int x\,dx \\
   &= \frac{x^2}{2}\ln(x) - \frac{x^2}{4} + C
   \end{aligned}
   $$
